Rules:

1. BIRTH: Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbours will become live in the next generation.
2. ISOLATION: Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbours will die in the next generation.
3. OVERCROWDING: Each live cell with four or more live neighbours will die in the next generation.
4. SURVIVAL: Each live cell with either two or three live neighbours will remain alive for the next generation.
5. Another important fact about the rules for the game of life is that all rules apply to all cells at the same time.
